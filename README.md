# Deep_Learning_projects
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on the use of artificial neural networks, particularly deep neural networks, to model and solve complex problems. These deep networks are composed of multiple layers (hence "deep"), which allow them to automatically extract hierarchical features from data, making them exceptionally powerful for tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. Deep learning has witnessed remarkable advancements due to the availability of massive datasets and powerful computing hardware (e.g., GPUs) and has achieved groundbreaking results in areas like computer vision with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), natural language understanding with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformer models, and reinforcement learning in gaming and robotics. Its applications span autonomous vehicles, healthcare, finance, and beyond, reshaping industries and pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities.
